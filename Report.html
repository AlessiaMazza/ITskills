	    <h2>METODOLOGY, TOOLS and CHALLANGES</h2>
	    <p>
    	  We started our search consulting Polifonia Corpus with the module MusicBO. <br>
    	  First of all, we searched for general concepts, like people and instruments, and then we narrowed down respectively: <br>
          - The first group started searching for string instruments and bowed string instruments, finally choosing the violin as it was the most represented instrument in this category. <br>
          - The second group started searching for keyboard instruments and eventually chose the piano as it was the richest in information. <br>
          - The third group started searching for people, then artists, and composers, finally choosing Gaspare Spontini as the subject of the story. <br>
          We then deepened our research using the Wikidata knowledge base and we started creating sparql queries both using the MusicBO and Wikidata endpoint. <br>
          At this point, we designed an article-like data story on Melody using these queries to build the necessary templates according to the data we retrieved. <br>
          After saving and publishing our stories on Melody, we created a public and shared repository on GitHub, composed of a main page, the three articles and this report. <br>
          Every couple faced similar challenges: <br>
            - Starting our researches on MusicBO, we had some difficulties retrieving data about our subjects, so we chose to use also Wikidata to add information to our stories. <br>
            - Sometimes the results on Wikidata of the query were not coherent with the reality of facts, so we tried to create more specific queries. <br>
            - In the query about the awards won by Gaspare Spontini, we could not visualize all the images related to the ribbons and medals. This situation is probably due to the potential issue as stated on Wikidata. <br>
            - Another problem related to the biography of Gaspare Spontini is that in Wikidata there are two different places of death, one is Maiolati Spontini and the other is Ancona. This fact is probably due to two different sources one more specific than the other, as Maiolati Spontini is in the province of Ancona. <br>
            - On Melody, there is a major technical issue: if you want to eliminate or change the position of the templates, the process is cumbersome (sometimes it deleted the query, and sometimes it does not make you do that action).
