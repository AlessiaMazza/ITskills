			<h2> Exploring musical instruments: the violin </h2>
	 		<p> 
				This article provides a general insight of a very renowned musical instrument that has marked an important turning point in the history of music : the violin. In particular, we will observe and analyse the main features and the history of this splendid instrument, as well as the most influential and talented violinists that, by virtue of their remarkable works, achieved lasting fame and played a fundamental role in the history of violin music.
         	</p>
			<p> 
				In the first step, we proceeded with an exploration of WikiData in order to discover the amount of stringed instruments that were mentioned inside the knowledge base. A stringed instrument can be defined as any musical instrument having strings as the medium of sound production. 
				Then we narrowed-down our research and we proceeded with the exploration of the number of bowed string instruments: they owe their name to the fact that the sound is produced by rubbing the strings by means of horsehair stretched on a bow. In order to have a more clear visualization of the data that have been retrived, we created a counter query for both categories.

			</div>
			<p> 
				At this point, we looked for an instrument that had a great number of information both in the WikiData knowledge base and in the Polifonia corpus, therefore we chose the violin. The exploration of MusicBo corpus in Polifonia has been a source of inspiration for the creation of this article. The corpus provided texts that made reference to acclaimed violinists, their carreer and different versions of this musical instrument which are all topics on which the research consequently focused on.

			<h3> The violin: an overview </h3>
			<div class="one">

			<p> 
				The violin is a bowed string instrument with four strings tuned in perfect fifths. It is the smallest and highest-pitched member of the violin family of string instruments, which also includes the viola, cello and double bass. <br>
	    		A violin is occasionally informally called a fiddle, in spite of what kind of music is being played on it. The word "violin" traces its origins in the Romance languages from the Middle Latin word vitula, meaning "stringed instrument". This word may also be the source of the Germanic "fiddle". A person who plays the violin is called a violinist or fiddler, and a person who produces or repairs them is called a luthier, or simply a violin maker. 
			</p>
			<p> 
				The violin has been traditionally employed as an accompaniment to singing and dancing. It is also an important classical solo instrument, as well as taking pride of place at the front of orchestras. The violin is both an object of great beauty and symmetry as well as an ingenious work of mechanical design. In the following table, we will look more closely at the main parts that compose this instrument.

				The violin has represented orchestral music in the general public for a protracted time. However, it is not commonly known that violins come in several and different types. This instrument has changed its lifespan for various reasons, leading to the production of different models. <br>
				In the following table you can find some of its most famous variants, from the first standard violins that already existed in the sixteenth century, such as the baroque violin (which is considered to be the forefather of the modern violin), to more modern variants such as the neolin, an electro-acoustic violin which incorporates a fretted fingerboard, cutaway body, and tremolo mechanism based on the electric guitar.

			<h4> Famous violinists </h4>
			<p> 
				As previously mentioned, the current popularity of the violin is also due to all the incredible musicians that, thanks to their virtuosity and outstanding works, managed to play a crucial role in violin history, providing a rich heritage to future generations. At first, we looked for the number of male and female violinists inside WikiData. 
			</p>
			<div class="two">
				<img src="femaleviolinist.png" width="200" height="200">
			</div>
			<div class="two">
				<img src="maleviolinists.png" width="200" height="200"> 
			</div>
			<p> 
				We then narrowed down our research, focusing on the influence that these artists still have in musical history and practice. As a consequence, we searched for the ten most influential violinists. 
			</p>
			<div class="one">
				<img src="ciambella22.png" width="450" height="300">
			</div>
			<p> 
				We also made a comparison between the number of musical compositions that several famous violinists composed during the course of their lives. 
			</p>
			<div class="one">
				<img src="barchartviolin.png" width="500" height="350">

			<p> 
				The map below is useful to have an idea of the number and distribution of violinists around the world. By means of this useful instrument, it is possible to observe that the largest number of violinists is concentrated in Europe, notably in the area between Germany, Austria and Czech Republic.
			</p>
			<div class="one">
				<img src="mapviolin.png" width="500" height="350">

			<p> 
				Moreover, we added a text search that allows you to look for famous violinists born in a specific country or city. For each violinist, is it possible to observe their most famous works, if the data is present on WikiData.

				Among the influential violinists that have been mentioned during the course of this research, there is one famous musician that deserves our attention: George Frideric Handel.
			</p>
			<h5> George Frideric Handel </h5>
			<div class="one">
				<img src="handelimage.png" width="250" height="275">
			</div>
			<p> 
				George Frideric Handel was a German-British composer and violinist. Born and raised in Halle (Germany), Handel showed interest in musical instruments and composition since the early stages of his life. After receiving his training, he worked as a composer in Hamburg and Italy before settling in London in 1712, where he lived for the rest of his life.

			<p> 
				Handel was a composer of the late Baroque era, and he is deemed to be one of the most prominent composers of his time, influencing a whole generation of composers with his unique blend of Italian, German, and English musical styles. Handel’s works spanned a variety of musical genres, including opera, orchestral music, chamber music, and choral works. He is most famous for his oratorios, which are large-scale musical works for choirs, soloists, and orchestras.

			<p> 
				Handel’s musical style was heavily influenced by the Italian Baroque style, which he encountered during his time in Italy. He incorporated elements of the Italian style into his own compositions, blending them with elements of German and English musical traditions. In the following table, some of his most notable works can be observed.

			<p>
				Handel's musical style was influential in his time and it continues to be celebrated today for its combination of beauty, grandeur and emotional depth. His works are considered milestones of the Baroque era and they are an enduring testament to his mastery of the musical arts.
			</p>
			<p>
				To conclude, this research has allowed us to recreate a significant part of violin’s history and its role in music. The combination of the different tools that have been consulted has led to a prolific article. Even if those who read the outcome of this research are not music experts, the information that are provided are intriguing and practical.
