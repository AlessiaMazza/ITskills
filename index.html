                Our group is composed of six people: <br>
              - Rossella Verolino and Giovanna De Felice worked on a story about the piano and the most productive pianist. <br>
              - Elena Benelli and Domiziana Leorin worked on a story about the violin and the most influential violinists. <br>
              - Alessia Mazza and Veronica Spena worked on a story about a famous Italian composer and the museum dedicated to him. <br>
              Scrolling through each article you will find out more details and curiosities about the history and the main features of these instruments while exploring these musicians' and composers' personal and professional backgrounds. <br>
